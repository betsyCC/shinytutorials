In R, there are number of R packages for conducting network analysis (i.e., <a href=\"https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/\">tidygraph</a>, <a href=\"http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/\">Diagrammer</a>, <a href=\"http://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/\">visNetwork</a>, and many other at <a href=\"https://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/\">gallery.htmlwidgets.org</a>). I'm a big fan of the <a href=\"http://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/\">networkD3</a> package as it's a great interface to <a href=\"https://d3js.org\">D3</a>. However, customizing visualizations can be tricky. This tutorial will demonstrate how to define custom events (i.e., hover, click).</p>\n<p>This tutorial does not focus so much on data preparation, but more on creating interactive visualizations and customizing them. I would recommend <a href=\"https://www.jessesadler.com/post/network-analysis-with-r/\">Jesse Sadler's tutorials on network analysis in R</a> for more information about network analysis and for step-by-step guides for preparing your data.</p>\n<span id=\"work\"/>\n<h2>How does this app work?</h2>\n<h3>Defining the UI</h3>\n<h3>Defining the Server</h3>\n<h3>Rendering the network</h3>\n<h3>Adding text</h3>\n<h3>Adding click events</h3>\n<h3>Adding hover events</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"Shiny and networkD3","subtitle":"Creating network visualizations using the networkD3 package","abstract":"The networkD3 package allows you to build interactive networks.
