This means that all web elements must work for individuals using assistive technologies and adapt to other conditions that may prevent individudals from accessing or reduce an individuals ability to effectively use a site.</p>\n<p>Ensuring colors have high contrast is a common aspect of web accessibility. Consider the following figure.

If our site has video, we want give users the option to read a transcription of the clip and have the ability to enable captioning. We also want our site to work well with Assistive Technologies (AT) and that individuals accessing our site with an AT can navigate our site. </p>\n<p>In web development, conditions are commonly grouped into four categories: visual, auditory, motor/mobility, and cognitive/neurological (<a href=\"#1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#3\">3</a>). These categories can be expanded even further to include temporary and situational conditions (<a href=\"#3\">3</a>).</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p><img src=\"ms_include_design_persona_spectrum.png\"></p>\n<p><em>Source: Microsoft Inclusive Design 101</em></p>\n</div>\n<p> This is by no means a comprehensive or an \"official\" list, but it is important to start thinking about who might be visiting your site, how they are viewing content, and in what context (i.e., environment, situation, etc.).</p>\n<span id=\"a-brief-introduction-to-wcag\"/>\n<h3>A Brief Introduction to WCAG</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> is a set standards for all web content in terms of structure and style.
