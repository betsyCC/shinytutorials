## Why would I need this?

Network analysis and visualizations provide a ... for showing interconnectivity in a given sample. In R, there are number of R packages for conducting network analysis (i.e., [tidygraph](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/), [Diagrammer](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/), [visNetwork](http://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/), and many other at [gallery.htmlwidgets.org](https://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/)). I'm a big fan of the [networkD3](http://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/) package as it's a great interface to [D3](https://d3js.org). However, customizing visualizations can be tricky. This tutorial will demonstrate how to define custom events (i.e., hover, click).


This tutorial does not focus so much on data preparation, but more on creating interactive visualizations and customizing them. I would recommend [Jesse Sadler's tutorials on network analysis in R](https://www.jessesadler.com/post/network-analysis-with-r/) for more information about network analysis and for step-by-step guides for preparing your data.
