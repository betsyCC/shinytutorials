## About

For R and shiny enthusiasts, landing a role with the main focus on using shiny is a dream come true. 

Before learning how to write code, most of my experience was in clinical research and case work. Overtime, I became interested in the data side of running research studies and trials. I was fortunate in my early career to get the opportunity to learn more about databases, developing computerized tasks for experimentation, and analyzing data. 

In my first research position, I was tasked to learn R and analyze data for a paper. I had no experience working in a scripting environment nor had I used a command line. I had a lot of good support and help from my mentor to learn more. During this time, I caught the coding bug and wanted to learn everything I could. Over the next few years, I held a positions where experience in R was preferred, but it wasn't the primary focus. These opportunities allowed me to continue to learn and build up a portfolio. 

Fast forward six years, I landed my first full-time development job that had a focus in R and shiny. Everyday, I conducted analysis which led to shinyapps and visualizations for various internal reporting platforms. This post includes some tips for moving your career into a development area and some interview questions that you may want to think about. The questions are grouped into a few sections: knowledge, experience, and tasked-based questions.

All questions were written down as soon close to the end of the interview as possible. Many of the interviews that I attended, required that I complete a task ahead of the interview (i.e., a week before or the day of). I've grouped these questions into the "tasked-based" section. As these questions were specific to the interview task, the concepts or themes highlighted in the questions might give you an indication of what to expect.

## Questions

### Standard

- "Why did you apply for this job?"
- "What do you want to get out of this role?"


### Knowledge

- **Design**: "When preparing visualizations, what features - specifically design elements - do you use? In other words, what are the key elements for an effective presentation?"

### Experience

- **Impact**: "What are some experiences you had where your report was used to make an impact?"
- **Managing Differences**: "How would you handle a situation where others many have a difference of opinion to even if the outcomes are the same? This could be in design, methodology, etc."
- **Time Management**: "In this role, you will encounter periods of high-demand, overlapping deadlines, 

### Task-based

- **Scenario**: suppose there is a major issue that occurred during data collection or entry that effected the reporting process. Prepare a presentation on a situation where this occured in your line of work. 

    - "Describe what systems you would put in place to prevent issues like this from occuring. So, what checks would you run? How would you validate data before reporting on it?"

- **Analysis Skills**: For one interview, I was given a dataset a week before the interview and asked to find the answers to a series of questions. These questions were fairly straightforward - "Which group had the most X?" and "What was the average Y by Z?" and so forth. I was also asked to conduct my own analysis and to create a visualization based on my findings. The questions asked on this part of the interview are as followed.

    - "Talk about your approach to completing the visualization. So, from a design perspective. Why did you choose this design?"
    - "How did you approach cleaning the data?" 
    - "Tell us about the results and what it tells about the research topic"


## Tips

- Interview panels want specifics and real life examples. In your job materials and during the interview, makes sure you are providing evidence from your professional experience.
