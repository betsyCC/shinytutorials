## About

I'm a big fan of shiny apps and I've built a many apps over the year - many just for fun! I've collected a few tips and tricks for building shiny apps and I wanted a place to share them. At the moment, these tutorials most likely focus on "how to" demonstrations. In the future, I will also talk about design and optimizing performance of shiny apps. My goal is to write a new tutorial about every month.

If you'd like to get involved, I'm always looking for collaborators, ideas, etc.. Feel free to send me a message.
