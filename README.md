# Shiny Tutorials

A collection of tips and tutorials for building shiny apps. The site can be found here: [davidruvolo51.github.io/shinytutorials](https://davidruvolo51.github.io/shinytutorials/).

## About

This site was built using gatsbyjs. In the past, I've written the tutorials in pure html. It was a pain to manage the content manually. I've used R packages for creating blogs, but I found them a bit bulky and the "out of the box" templates were not always compatible with what I wanted to do or required a lot of work to incorprate a desired style/structure. I've wanted to learn react and gastbyjs was a good opportunity to make the switch. So far I'm a big fan!

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the site: edits, new posts, etc. Feel free to get in touch with me if you are interested. Use the development branch to build the site and commit the `public/` folder to the `updates` branch. Open a pull request and we can work through the changes.
